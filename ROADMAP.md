# Roadmap
The following things can be done to further improve the tool.
1) Currently the tool only supports Integers as Number values. Can be extended to support other Number values like Floating Points, Hexadeicmals, etc.
2) The String values can be validated for more escape sequences.
3) A spinner can be shown in the terminal using a library like [ora](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ora) to improve user experience when validating very large files.
4) Support for validating multiple files in one command. Currently we can pass only one file for validation.
